💥 Another JSON Resume theme...

The difference this time, is that now it's AWESOME! 💫

## Features

* Keep your resume offline if you want to: the theme is self-contained.
* Great Font Awesome icons.
* Gorgeous Open Sans web font.
* Optimized for print and screen readers.
* Contains Schema.org markup to make the most of your content.
* All fields are optional, pick what you need!

> Notes: some fields are mapped to achieve some other features that needed support on this theme:
>
> - _highlights_ under work section is used to describe the code stack, e.g. React, express.js, etc...
> - _skills_ section, level is a number from 1 to 5 as a string, e.g. for a skill on React with level 3 you should write:
>
>   ```json
>   ...
>   skills: [{
>     "name": "React",
>     "level": "3",
>     "keywords": []
>   },
>   ...
>   ]
>   ...
>   ```

## Usage

Install the theme,

```sh
npm install --save jsonresume-theme-hexagon
```

Then use it:

```js
'use strict';

var theme = require('jsonresume-theme-hexagon');

var resume = require('./resume.json');
process.stdout.write(theme.render(resume));
```

### Adding skills and skill groups
All skills that are displayed on the left side of the resume must be registered in `./mapper.json`. Simply add your 
additional skills to an existing group or add another group altogether.
